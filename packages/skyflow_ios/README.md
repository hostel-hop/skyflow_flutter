This is an implementation of the [`skyflow_platform_interface`](https://github.com/flutter-skyflow/skyflow_flutter/tree/main/packages/skyflow_platform_interface) package for iOS.

## Usage

### With the `skyflow_flutter` plugin

This package is the endorsed implementation of the [`skyflow_flutter` plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/skyflow_flutter), so it gets automatically added to your [dependencies](https://flutter.dev/platform-plugins/) by adding the `skyflow_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  skyflow_flutter: 
```
